<p>In college, the default language that the computer science department used was Java. OOP was king and still is in lots of places. However, recently there has been a new trend emerging; functional programming. Java introduced aspects of functional programming in Java 8.</p>
<p>My introduction to functional programming was in the language ML and Racket from the Coursera class, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages">Programming Languages</a>, taught by Dan Grossman. I highly recommend the course as a primer in functional programming and programming languages in general. I later took Functional Programming Principles in Scala on Coursera taught by the Martin Odersky, the designer of the Scala programming language. I enjoyed the simplicity, expressiveness, interoperability with Java, strong static typing, and of course its great support for functional programming.</p>
<p>I would like to continue to grow my knowledge of functional programming, category theory, functional program design and will be doing so with Scala.</p>
