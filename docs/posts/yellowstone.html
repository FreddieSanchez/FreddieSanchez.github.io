  <h1 id="yellowstone---june-23-27-2025">Yellowstone - June 23-27,
  2025</h1>
  <p>Our youngest daughter just finished 4th grade. And as a 4th grader,
  she is eligible for a free National Park pass through
  https://everykidoutdoors.gov/index.htm. We did this with all our other
  kids and it was a great experience. For our son’s 4th grade trip we
  drove to Yosemite National Park stopping at Joshua Tree National Park,
  and Sequoia National Park. For our eldest daughter’s 4th grade trip we
  drove to Michigan stopping at Mesa Verde National Park, Mount
  Rushmore, Badlands National Park, and Painted Rocks National Lake
  shore.</p>
  <p>Based on our all previous national park trips, we decided to visit
  Yellowstone National Park. Driving 1,000+ miles would take a bit too
  much time, so we decided to fly. We wanted to include another National
  Park on our way, so we decided to fly into Jackson Hole, Wyoming and
  visit Grand Teton National Park before heading to Yellowstone National
  Park.</p>
  <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
  <p>I started a spreadsheet and a shared map that would to track our
  trip details. We started to collect everyone’s activity ideas. My son
  is an avid <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking_(hobby)">benchmark
  hunter</a>, so he naturally included a few benchmarks gathering
  missions. This is actually a fun idea as it takes us to random places
  that we may not otherwise visit. This often includes stopping off the
  side of the road and traipsing through fields or planning hikes to
  find benchmarks. Our activities were split into two areas: Canyon
  Village and Old Faithful. We booked our travel to Jackson Hole Airport
  (JAC), car rental, and lodging at Canyon Lodge and Old Faithful Snow
  Lodge.</p>
  <h2 id="day-1---june-23-2025-tucson-to-jackson-hole">Day 1 - June 23,
  2025: Tucson to Jackson Hole</h2>
  <p>We planned a very early flight to maximize our time in the park and
  work in some activities on our first day. We had a short layover in
  Salt Lake City, Utah before flying to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I slept
  most of the flight from SLC to Jackson Hole, but woke up as we
  descended into Jackson Hole. The view of the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton_Range">Teton Range</a> was
  surprisingly awesome. It was a clear day with just some cloud cover
  over the snow capped mountains. I had no idea that we’d be so close to
  the range, or that we’d have such a magical view during our
  descent.</p>
  <p>Jackson Hole doesn’t have any jet bridges. You walk down the ramp
  to the tarmac and get to experience the 50°F, cool, fresh mountain air
  and the awesome view of the Tetons. Quite the change from our hometown
  of Tucson, AZ where the low temperature was 20°F hotter.</p>
  <p>We made our way through the small airport. We picked up some
  expensive sandwiches from a grab and go deli, and rented bear spray
  from the kiosk in the airport.</p>
  <p>We picked up our rental SUV (Dodge Durango) and headed out of the
  airport. We drove north towards Yellowstone National Park. We saw some
  bison right off the main road in the first 10 minutes of our drive! We
  stopped at Cunningham Cabin to find a potential benchmark, have a
  picnic lunch, and take in another view of the Tetons.</p>
  <p>We continued our drive north and entered Grand Teton National Park,
  where my youngest filled out her National Parks Pass. We drove through
  the park, stopping at a Jackson Lake Overlook, and then continued
  north to the South Entrance of Yellowstone National Park.</p>
  <p>We made one stop at Moose Falls, which is just inside the South
  Entrance of Yellowstone. We took a short hike down the hill to the
  falls and took some pictures. The falls were beautiful, and it was a
  great way to start our Yellowstone adventure. My son was able to also
  bag his first benchmark of the trip, which was a benchmark disk on a
  rock wall near the falls.</p>
  <p>We arrived at Canyon Village in the early afternoon. We checked
  into Canyon Lodge where the girls got a deluxe room and my son and I
  shared a standard room. The rooms were pretty bare bones, no TV,
  microwave, or fridge, but luckily there was a coffee maker. I made a
  quick coffee and we headed out. My son and I headed out to hike up
  Mount Washburn and the girls were going to explore Tower Falls and the
  surrounding area.</p>
  <p>The hike was a continuous uphill trek that wasn’t too strenuous.
  There was still some snow in some sections, but easily traversed. We
  made our way to the top of <a
  href="https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-trail-dunraven-pass-mount-washburn.htm">Mount
  Washburn</a>, which is 10,219 feet (3115 m) above sea level. My son
  found a couple of benchmarks at the top including one on the
  neighboring hill near the summit. We took in the breathtaking views of
  the surrounding mountains and valleys. The weather cool but quite
  windy with some fluffy clouds making the views that much more
  spectacular. Knowing that cell phone reception was going to be suspect
  in the park, I purchased some two-way radios. We used them to
  communicate with the girls while we were on the summit.</p>
  <p>After we got back down the mountain, we headed back to the lodge
  and went to the dining room for dinner. The food wasn’t the best, and
  quite expensive for what it was, but we were hungry and tired. We
  headed back to our rooms and got ready for bed. We were all exhausted
  from the long day of travel and hiking, but excited for the adventures
  that lay ahead in Yellowstone National Park.</p>

  id="day-2---june-24-2025-grand-canyon-of-the-yellowstone-and-mud-volcanoes">Day
  2 - June 24, 2025: Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and Mud
  Volcanoes</h2>
  <p>We woke and headed for a quick breakfast at the Canyon Lodge Dining
  Room. Visited the Visitor’s Center where we learned more about
  Yellowstone, and the kids collected their Junior Ranger booklets. We
  bought some sandwiches and snacks at the Canyon Village General Store
  for lunch for later. Our plan for the day was to explore the Grand
  Canyon of the Yellowstone on both rims. We were going to drive the
  North Rim, have a picnic lunch at the Wapiti Lake Picnic Area, then
  walk/hike South Rim trail.</p>
  <p>We first made our way to the North Rim Drive, which is a scenic
  drive that offers stunning views of the Grand Canyon of the
  Yellowstone. We stopped at all the lookout points, starting with the
  Brink of Lower Falls. We walked the steep switch backed trail and was
  able to get up close to the river and the brink of the Lower Falls.
  Both Lookout Point, and Grand View provided breathtaking views of the
  canyon and the Lower Falls. I think the Grand View was my favorite, as
  the sun came out and really brought out the colors in the canyon
  walls.</p>
  <p>We had a picnic lunch and my son and I walked the South Rim trail
  and met the girls at Artist Point. The South Rim trail is a relatively
  easy walk and mostly paved. Artist Point was quite crowded but still
  provided a spectacular view of the Lower Falls and the length of the
  canyon. The sun was behind some clouds dulling the colors. It started
  to rain a bit as we headed back to the lodge.</p>
  <p>After a nap, we headed back out and drove to the Mud Volcano area
  where we had our first real experience of the geothermal features of
  Yellowstone. On our way we saw some awesome views of bison along the
  side of the road, and in the valley along the Yellowstone River. We
  walked the short loop trail at the Mud Volcano area, that took us past
  the Mud Volcano, Dragon’s Mouth Spring and the Sulphur Cauldron on the
  other side of the road. The Dragon’s Mouth Spring was quite impressive
  as it steamed away and produced waves in the pool outside the cave. My
  wife remarked that she expected to see the Rabbit of Caerbannog from
  Monty Python and the Holy Grail come out of the cave.</p>
  <p>At Sulphur Cauldron we were able to see a grizzly bear and two cubs
  on the hill across the Yellowstone river. We used my daughter’s
  binoculars to get a closer look at the bears and try to get some
  pictures.</p>
  <p>We finished the day with dinner at the Canyon Lodge Dining Room.
  The food was better than the previous night. We made a final stop at
  the Canyon Village General Store to pick up ice cream and breakfast
  for the next day.</p>
  <p>Later that night we went to a ranger lead program to learn about
  the night sky and do some star gazing. It didn’t get dark until well
  after 10:30 PM. The ranger told us some stories about the different
  constellations and pointed to ones that were visible in the night sky.
  I wished it got darker sooner, but it is what it is.</p>

  <h2 id="day-3---june-25-2025-avalanche-peak-and-old-faithful">Day 3 -
  June 25, 2025: Avalanche Peak and Old Faithful</h2>
  <p>We had a leisurely breakfast in our room and packed up our things.
  We checked out of the lodge and headed out of the Canyon Village. The
  plan was for my son and I to to hike <a
  href="https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-trail-avalanche-peak.htm">Avalanche
  Peak</a> while the girls explore the surrounding lakes, then drive to
  Old Faithful.</p>
  <p>Avalanche Peak was a great hike. Both my son and I were used to the
  vertical gain as all the hikes in our hometown of Tucson are up
  mountains. The trail was in great shape below the tree line, but above
  the tree line, it was talus and snow. We essentially bushwhacked our
  way up the mountain, following the trail as best we could. My favorite
  part was hiking the ridge line to the summit where we had a 360° view
  of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The summit was covered in
  snow and made it impossible for my son to find any benchmarks (if
  there were any). We again were able to contact my wife over the radio
  letting her know our progress and expected arrival time back at the
  trail head. The way back down was uneventful, but we did see a beaver
  which I thought was a large squirrel at first.</p>
  <p>We drove back toward the Grand Loop Rd and made a stop at the
  Fishing Bridge to observe the USGS Stream Gauging station. We finally
  made it over to the Lake General Store to pick up some lunch items and
  snacks for the drive to Old Faithful. I walked with my son to find a
  benchmark off a trail up the road and one near the Lake Lodge Cabins.
  We saw a lone Bison near the Lake General Store just off the road
  snacking on the grass.</p>
  <p>We made our way to Old Faithful and checked into the Old Faithful
  Snow Lodge. We were still split up into a girls room and a boys room,
  but this time our room had two beds and a fridge. We dropped off our
  things and headed out to see Old Faithful erupt. We had dinner at the
  Old Faithful Lodge Cafeteria, which about as good as Canyon Lodge
  Dining Room.</p>

  4 - June 26, 2025: Upper Geyser Basin, Black Sand Basin, Grand
  Prismatic Spring</h2>
  <p>Geyser touring was the name of the game for the day. Part of the
  board walk from Grand Geyser to Grotto Geyser was closed so we stuck
  to the paved path. We visited most of the geysers but didn’t really
  see any erupt. We made it to the end of the trail at Morning Glory
  Pool which was super colorful and beautiful. We went on a couple of
  side quests off the main route there and watched Grand Geyser erupt
  from a distance on our way to Daisy Geyser. We sat and waited for
  Daisy Geyser to erupt. We made our way down the trail and saw Punch
  Bowl Spring, which was one of my favorites, and Black Sand Pool. We
  walked back toward civilization and stopped at the Old Faithful Basin
  Store to pick up some sandwiches for lunch. On our way out we saw a
  lone bison who understood the assignment and was in the exact position
  as the warning sign. We drove to the Grand Prismatic Spring area but
  it was too crowded so we turned around and went to the Black Sand
  Basin instead. This was a neat area with some beautiful hot springs
  and geysers. My favorite being the Rainbow Pool.</p>
  <p>We drove back to the Old Faithful area and split up so the girls
  can rest and my son and I could go back to the Upper Geyser Basin to
  see if we could catch any geysers erupting. We walked the boardwalk
  behind Old Faithful and got super lucky as we were able to see Beehive
  and then had a wait for Grand erupt. Grand Geyser was by far my
  favorite as it had vents and pools that erupted along with the main
  eruption. We met back up with the girls and drove out to Fairy Falls
  to see the Grand Prismatic Spring from above. The hike over wasn’t
  terrible, a little elevation gain but the mosquitoes were getting to
  me. We made it to the overlook but we weren’t able to stay long as the
  mosquitoes were relentless. You could barley make out the bison that
  ran into the spring earlier in the year.</p>
  <p>We made it back to the Old Faithful area and had dinner at the
  Geyser Grill. We got there just in time before the end of the end of
  the dinner service. The food was pretty good, and we were all pretty
  tired from the long day of walking and geyser watching.</p>
  <h2 id="day-5---june-27-2025-old-faithful-to-jackson-hole">Day 5 -
  June 27, 2025: Old Faithful to Jackson Hole</h2>
  <p>We had a leisurely breakfast at the Old Faithful Inn Dining Room.
  The service wasn’t the best. Long wait times to get seated and to get
  our food. We headed back to our rooms and packed up our things and
  checked out of the Old Faithful Snow Lodge. We stopped by the visitor
  center so the kids could turn in their Junior Ranger booklets and take
  the Junior Ranger oath. We were able to see Old Faithful erupt one
  last time from inside the visitors center. It was almost 2 hours
  between eruptions and out of the predicted window. We concluded our
  visit by visiting the General Store and buying some souvenirs. I got a
  bison hat and earlier picked up a shirt from the Visitor’s Center gift
  shop. We drove to West Thumb Geyser Basin and walked the boardwalk
  there. The West Thumb Geyser Basin was a short walk a great way to end
  our geyser watching.</p>
  <p>We drove back down toward the South Entrance. We got out of
  Yellowstone and made our way to our planned stop at Jenny Lake
  Overlook in the Grand Teton National Park for lunch. My son and wife
  headed into a scrub field to find a final set of benchmark. We stopped
  at the Grand Teton Visitors Center to use the restrooms and to get up
  and stretch.</p>
  <p>We filled up the rental with gas and made our way back to Jackson
  Hole Airport. We returned the rental, made our way through security,
  returned our bear spray, and all we had left was to wait for our
  flight. We had a short layover in Salt Lake City but that was extended
  when our connection was delayed. We got back about an hour later than
  expected.</p>
